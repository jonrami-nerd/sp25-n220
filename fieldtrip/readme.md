## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

After going to the Eiteljorg, I kept thinking about the slab of wood near the cafe, near the stairs that said "please touch". After doing more research, that type of wood was used to make Totem poles, such as the Golden Hill Totem Pole of Indianapolis, which just like other Totem Poles was made out of western red-cedar wood. 

With this I'm making project about the Totem Poles.

### Core Webpages

* Home page: A list and brief description of different Totem Poles, each pole will have a seperate webpage

* Totem Poles webpages: More in depth information on the Totem Pole, its history, and material used.

* Material Used section: Will contain a clickable picture of the wood that the pole was made out of, (inspired by the slab of wood in the Eiteljorg)

### Design Choices

**Colors:**

* Wood Brown for background

* Cream like color for content on page (cream box over brown background)

* Navy blue color for text

* Green for button background with white text
