<h1>Store</h1>
<p>
    You are tasked with showing the calculations for the total of an item after tax, both with discount and without. The item's shelf price is $40.99, the sales tax is 7% (0.07), and the discount rate is 10% (0.10). Item's are only eligible for the discount if they are over $50. You are to console messages for the total after tax, discount eligibility of the item, and discounted total after tax separately.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <strong>Equations:</strong><br>
    Total Tax = price x (1 + sales tax)<br>
    Discounted Total After Tax = price x (1 + sales tax) x (1 - discount rate)
