### Websites vs Web Applications
<!-- Brief description of understanding. Use any combination of markdown techniques. Should be more than 2 sentences. -->
Websites are typically used to display information or for business websites, or portfolios, some examples are:

2. [Fandom - Hatsune Miku](https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Hatsune_Miku)
3. [Portfolio - Yuta Abe](https://yuta-abe.com/)

Web Applications are more interactive (similarly to a mobile app) but running in the browser. Some examples are:

2. [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)
3. [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/)
